      <xhtml:p>75mm Unitron refractor with the following eyepieces: 25mm (48x), 18mm (67x),
        12.5mm (96x), and 9mm (133x). I also used a 10x60 binoculars, primarily to help locate
        objects.</xhtml:p>

    <xhtml:p>My plan for the evening was to look at some stars in Her. At one point I saw a
      rather nice meteor moving northward through Cyg, approximately parallel to the main axis
      of the constellation. I also noticed, over the course of the evening, several satellites.
      They were all moving south to north through the Hercules area. In one case I caught one
      flashing through my 133x field of view!</xhtml:p>

    <xhtml:p>I saw the first firefly of the season tonight as well.</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:p>This was a very nice double. It was barely resolved with the 25mm eyepiece but
        the best view was with 9mm. At 133x there was quite a bit of separation between the
        components but not so much as to be "wide"; they made a pleasing pair. The secondary is
        noticeably fainter than the primary but not excessively so. The secondary appeared
        slightly blue-grey compared to the primary but it could easily have been an
      illusion.</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:p>I observed this star at several magnifications including with the 9mm (133x). I
        was unable to see the secondary due, presumably, to its faintness. The glare from the
        primary was excessive when averted vision was used and direct vision was apparently not
        enough to see the faint companion.</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:p>I got a very nice view of this cluster in my new 10x60 binoculars. The 10x
        magnification was enough to show the cluster well without spreading it out too much. The
        cluster appeared reasonably rich and interesting. I got the impression that it was
        somewhat oblong in shape.</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:p>Easily resolved with higher magnifications. I got the best view with the 9mm
        eyepiece. The secondary is considerably fainter than the primary and somewhat "involved"
        with the glare from the primary. It is, however, distinct from that glare and visible
        without any question. The primary was clearly orange while the secondary might have had
        a slight greenish hue. Overall I found the glare from the primary to be a detraction; I
        felt that Rho Her was more satisfying overall.</xhtml:p>

    <notes>
      <xhtml:p>Despite the wide separation I found this double somewhat tricky due to the
        faintness of the secondary. With the 25mm eyepiece (48x) it was difficult, though
        possible, to see the secondary using averted vision. The glare from the primary was the
        main problem. At a higher magnification the secondary was more easily seen because it
        was farther from the primary and thus more inclined to be out of the primary's glare. I
        got the best overall view with the 12.5mm (96x). Alas, the wide separation and the
        faintness of the secondary didn't make this a very satisfying double. It didn't really
        "feel" like a double at all.</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:p>Easily split using even the 25mm eyepiece. This was a very nice double. The near
        equal magnitudes and relatively close separation gave a very satisfying view. Both stars
        appeared basically white although one star did appear to have a slight reddish hue
        compared to the other. The best overall view was with the 18mm eyepiece.</xhtml:p>

    <notes>
      <xhtml:p>Based on my experience with ADS-10535 I was expecting this double to also be
        somewhat disappointing. However, despite the wide separation and faint secondary it
        actually gave a rather nice view. The secondary showed up fine with the 25mm and was
        easily visible with direct vision. The glare from the primary was also not excessive. I
        think the main reason why this double was more satisfying than ADS-10535 was because
        averted vision was not required to see either component.</xhtml:p>
