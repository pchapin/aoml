        The weather element contains some "precise" data and a notes element for more "informal"
        comments. Notice that I'm also providing a notes element for each precise data field as
        well. That element is intended to store any additional information about the observation
        that the observer feels might be significant such as the instrument used or any quirks
        of the measurement that might affect its accuracy. -->

          The notes element inside the weather element is intended to describe the weather in

          not fall into the other elements. -->

        The actual astronomical sky conditions are below. Although most of these quantities are
        subjective in nature I tried to follow the same sort of structure as I did with the
        weather element. In particular, I included a notes child element in each element for
        unstructured comments. At the moment only limiting-mag has a value field for "precise"
        data. In the future some of the other elements may also acquire a value field. -->

        The notes element contains a summary of the sky conditions in general terms. It reflects
        what one observer might say to another in a couple of easy sentences to quickly convey
        the general quality of the night. -->

      <!--
        The rating element contains a numeric summary of the sky conditions. I included this so
        that I could easily process a large number of observations and make some statements, for
        example, about the number of "good" nights during any particular time period. The actual
        rating system that I use is described in sky-codes.htm. Currently the format of this
        element is open so other observers could use a different rating system. I'm not sure
        if that's a good thing or not. -->
