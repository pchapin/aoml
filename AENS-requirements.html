    <h1>AENS Requirements</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>This document describes the requirements for my Astronomical Event Notification Service
      (AENS). The contents of this document are subject to rapid change and should only be
      considered approximate.</p>

    <p>Astronomical events will be stored in files marked up with Astronomical Event Markup
      Language (AEML). These event files will be styled for web presentation as well as serve as
      the source of events for the notification service. AEML can and will be adapted to suit
      the needs of both the notification service and web presentation.</p>

    <p>Subscribers indicate their desire to receive notification of upcoming astronomical events
      by filling out a suitable web form. The script that backs that form enters their
      information into a database. Initially I'd like to use a simple text file (an XML
      document?) for this database. I want to avoid the extra complications of setting up and
      dealing with a database server at this point. Since the number of subscribers is likely to
      be small at first I believe this simplification is reasonable. Eventually, however, it may
      be desirable to back the subscriber list with a full-powered relational database
      server.</p>

    <p>The notification service will run periodically and send out notifications of events to
      subscribers. Initially I will fix the notification time at, for example, 2 days. The
      service would thus send out notifications between 48 and 72 hours (2 and 3 days) before
      the event actually occurs. Since the service does not run continuously it follows that
      notifications must be sent during an interval around the specified notification time. I
      obviously don't want to send notifications too late but I also don't want to send them too
      early. The one day interval is a compromise.</p>

    <p>I plan to run the service every 24 hours. However, the exact time of day when the service
      runs is not relevant. I'm assuming that subscribers are in all time zones so the concepts
      of "night" and "day" are, in general, meaningless. For example it doesn't make sense to
      try and run the service at night so that people have notifications waiting for them in the
      morning. What constitutes night at my location might be the middle of the afternoon for
      some subscribers. However, by running the service only once per day, I ensure that no
      subscribers anywhere will receive more than one email message per day from the service. I
      feel that is important. Also another consequence of this policy is that all internal
      date/time calculations have to be done using universal time.</p>

    <p>Eventually I'd like to allow subscribers to specify their desired notification time as
      well as the type and "level" (advanced, novice, etc) of the events for which they want to
      be notified. Although I don't plan on implementing these features at first, they do have
      some implications for the system's design. In particular, the subscriber database needs to
      keep track of which events each subscriber has been notified of. Under no circumstances do
      I want to send a user multiple notifications for the same event (this isn't supposed to be
      a spamming engine). This in turn implies that events need to have unique ID numbers.
      Currently AEML requires a unique ID number on every event in a document. Thus the tuple
      (document-file-name, ID) should be unique across all events.</p>

    <p>The basic pseudo-code for the notification service is</p>

    <pre>
FOR &lt;each user in the subscriber database&gt; LOOP
  FOR &lt;each event in the current event list&gt; LOOP
    IF &lt;The user has not been notified about this event&gt; THEN
      &lt;Add this event to the current notification message&gt;
      &lt;Mark that the user has been notified about this event&gt;
    END
  END
  &lt;Send the user the current notification message (if not empty)&gt;
END
</pre>

    <p>This pseudo-code causes a single message to be sent to the subscriber even if there are
      multiple events active. This is the desired effect. Since every subscriber gets a
      customized message (due to eventual differences in configuration) it is necessary to
      reprocess the event list for each subscriber. I could imagine this being done with
      multiple SAX-style passes over the event list, but loading the event list into a DOM tree
      might make more sense.</p>

    <p>I'm anticipate keeping the event lists in files on a per-month basis. I think that is a
      good compromise between file size and number of files. It does mean that the notification
      service will have to load and consider two different event files occasionally. For
      example during the last few days of the month the system will have to look at the next
      month's file as well as the current month's to be sure to notify subscribers of events
      taking place during the first few days of the upcoming month. In general, once subscribers
      can change their notification time, the system will have to look forward an arbitrary
      amount, loading (or scanning) multiple event lists to cover all possible cases. This seems
      bothersomely complex.</p>

    <p>It would be interesting to build this entire system a second time, using a relational
      database to hold event information and then compare the two techniques. I doubt I'll have
      the time to do that anytime soon.</p>
