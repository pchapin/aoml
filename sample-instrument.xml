  <!--
    The idea of the instruments element is to serve as a container for multiple instruments. I'm
    imagining an observer sometimes keeping this information separate from the observations
    themselves and sometimes "attaching" this information to the observations (especially in
    cases where a single observation is being forwarded to someone else). -->

  <!--
    Significantly different types of optical instruments should have their own elements because
    the way of characterizing each is quite different (is this true?) The "key" attribute is
    intended to be used to refer to an instrument from an observation. It would be undesirable
    if an observer had to specify all of his/her instruments in each observation! I'm sure this
    problem has been thought about before; I'm not sure what the solution should be. -->

      <p>Each instrument type should have a notes element. This can be the same notes used in
        the sky conditions observations. It should allow for a fairly rich markup. Observers
        should be able to put all information of interest in notes elements if they want.</p>

    Many people observe with cameras. It is important to decorate pictures and such with
    information about the camera used to make that picture. I don't do any camera work so I'm
    not sure how to best handle this. It seems like file and exposure information needs to be
    handled elsewhere for sure. These elements should be just for the "static" information about
    a camera. -->
  <camera type="film"/>

  <!--
    Many observers are getting into CCD cameras these days so they may need a special element of
    their own. -->
  <camera type="CCD"/>

  <!--
    Clearly other instrument types might become important in the future. It is desirable if this
    schema allows for the easy, backwardly compatible addition of new instrument types. -->
