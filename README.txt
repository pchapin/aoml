The zip archive you expanded contains the schema and stylesheets for Astronomical Observation
Markup Language (AOML) and Astronomical Event Markup Language (AEML). Although not currently
stated explicitly, it is my intention to make this information available under the terms of the
GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) or some other, similar open license that is appropriate to
apply to XML schema documents.

Note that these files are subject to rapid, incompatible changes. AOML is very much under
development and, for now at least, backwards compatibility is *not* a priority. If you do use
the information here it is possible---even likely---that future versions of this/these schema(s)
will render old instance documents invalid and obsolete. There may come a time when this
information becomes stable. This is not that time. (Corollary: if you are actually trying to
follow this project, you might check my site regularly for new versions of things).

If you are looking to use an XML markup for astronomical observations in a serious way, you
might consider looking at the Observation Manager project on Sourceforge. That project shares
many similar goals to mine and is more likely to evolve into a widely adopted standard. The URL
for the Observation Manager project is

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/observation/

Thanks for your interest! I hope you find this information useful.
